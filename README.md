“And when comfort is what we want, one of the most powerful tonics alternative medicine offers is the word 'natural.' This word implies a medicine untroubled by human limitations, contrived wholly by nature or God or perhaps intelligent design.

But the use of 'natural' as a synonym for 'good' is almost certainly a product of our profound alienation from the natural world.”
